// ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW:
//
// 1. LOCK GRAPH: All locks should be tracked as nodes in a directed graph where
//    edges represent ordering dependencies (A â†’ B means A acquired before B).
//
// 2. THREAD TRACKING: Each thread should maintain a stack of currently held
//    locks to detect nested locking patterns and build dependencies.
//
// 3. DEADLOCK DETECTION: The system checks for cycles in the lock graph
//    to detect potential deadlocks. If a cycle is found, the system should
//    identify the lock and prevent the acquisition that would lead to a
//    deadlock.
